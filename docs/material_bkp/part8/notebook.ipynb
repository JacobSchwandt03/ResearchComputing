    "\n",
    "This is where python packages are downloaded from when you use `pip install <package-name>` and the code installs (even though `<package-name>` is not the name of a folder in your machine).\n",

    "## PyPi\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to https://pypi.org/ and search for `numpy`. On the [page](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) you can see the current version of the package that is downloaded by default when you run `pip install numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The webpage also gives you the `pip install` command you need to use, and on the left if you click on download files, you will see [things that look familiar](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#files):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The source distribution (a tar.gz file) containing the source code of the package.\n",
    "- The wheel distribution (a .whl file) containing a binary version of the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw both of these and how to build them in the previous parts of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of `numpy` you see that there are many wheels. This is because `numpy` is a truly compiled pakage that is not just pure Python (it uses C extensions). We will see more of this later in the course, when we talk about multi-language programming and `cibuildwheel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click on [release history](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#history) you will see the many different versions of the package that have been released and the dates they were released.\n",
    "You can click on any of the version to see details and how to install that specific version. For instance, if you click on `numpy-1.26.4` you will see that the installation command is `pip install numpy==1.26.4`.\n",
